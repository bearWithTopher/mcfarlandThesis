\section{Summary}
\label{chSMS_ID.summary}


This Chapter reports one state estimation and two parameter
identification algorithms for simple \acfp{SMS}.
%
An angular velocity observer is reported for a 3-\ac{DOF} rotational
plant, and a comparative analysis is reported between the novel and
two previously reported nonlinear angular velocity observers.
%
In numerical simulation all three show similar performance.
%
An \ac{AID} algorithm is reported for 3-\ac{DOF} rotational plants.
%
Numerical simulations of the inertia tensor \ac{AID} algorithm
corroborate the analytical stability analysis and investigate
parameter convergence for varying initial conditions, feedback gains,
and input torques.
%
An \ac{AID} algorithm for \acp{OKC} is also reported; the
local stability analysis reveals that plant parameter estimates
converge to values that provide plant model input-output behavior
identical to that of the actual second-order \ac{OKC} plant.
