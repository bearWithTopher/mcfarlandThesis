\section{Angular Velocity Observation for 3-\acs{DOF} Rotational Plants}
\label{chSMS_ID.sec.SO3_velObs}
  
This Section addresses the velocity observer problem for
three-dimensional second-order rotational plants of the form
(\ref{chModels.eq.SO3plant}) when the signals of torque input and
angular position are available, but the signal of plant angular
velocity is unavailable.  Using the input torque signal, angular
position signal, and plant's known inertia tensor the goal of the
velocity observer is to asymptotically exactly estimate the plant's
unknown angular velocity.

This Section presents a novel angular velocity observer, along with an
analysis of its stability. A comparative analysis of the novel and two
previously reported nonlinear angular velocity observers is
presented. Numerical simulations of all three show convergence of the
observer state to the plant state and similar performance for most
angular position trajectories and inertia tensors.
