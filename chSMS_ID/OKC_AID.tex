\section{Adaptive Identification for Open Kinematic Chains }
\label{chSMS_ID.sec.OKC_AID}

This Section addresses the problem of parameter estimation for an {\it n}-link
\acf{OKC} of the form of (\ref{chModels.eq.OKCplant}). We report a
novel \ac{AID} algorithm  which estimates these plant parameters.
This algorithm assumes the joint torque inputs, $\OKCinput$, joint
positions, $\OKCpos$, and joint velocities, $\dot{\OKCpos}$, are
accessible signals. 


%This Section proves the stability of a previously unreported
%nonlinear adaptive identifier for general \ac{OKC}.
