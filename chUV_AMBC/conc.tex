\section{Conclusion}  \label{chUV_AMBC.sec.conclusion}

This Chapter presents both theoretical and experimental results
concerning \ac{UV} \ac{AMBC}.
%
Section \ref{chUV_AMBC.sec.theory} reports \ac{MBC} and \ac{AMBC}
algorithms, along with a local proofs of stability.
%
Section \ref{chUV_AMBC.sec.unmodeledActDyn} reports an experimental
investigation of a previously unreported \ac{UV} \ac{AMBC} failure
mode where unmodeled thruster dynamics during thrust reversals cause
unstable parameter adaptation.
%
The Section also reports a novel two-step \ac{AMBC} algorithm which is
shown experimentally to provide stable trajectory tracking and
parameter adaptation in the presence of the unmodeled thruster
dynamics of our system.
%
Finally, it reports a comparative experimental analysis of the
two-step \ac{AMBC} algorithm with \ac{PDC}.
%
This experimental evaluation shows that two-step \ac{AMBC} provides
30\% better position tracking performance and 8\% worse velocity
tracking performance over \ac{PDC}.
