The Johns Hopkins Hydrodynamic Test Facility\cite{kinsey2003}
contains an indoor fresh water tank measuring \unit{7.75}{\m} in
diameter and \unit{4.25}{\m} deep, as shown in Figure
\ref{appenJHUHTF.fig.hydrolab}.  The facility is equipped with the
\ac{JHUROV}, a fully instrumented \ac{UV} designed for navigation and
control research.  The \ac{JHUROV} displaces \unit{150}{\kg} and is
actuated by six \unit{1.5}{\kWh} DC brushless electric direct drive
thrusters providing full control authority for 6-\ac{DOF}
maneuvers. Each thruster is controlled with a current-mode amplifier.
The \ac{JHUROV} control system generates the command current for each
thruster using data from {\it a-priori} {\it steady-state} thruster
calibration experiments; no feedback is used in generating the
commanded current.  The angular velocity of each thruster is
instrumented. This measured thruster angular velocity ($\omega_{th}$)
can be used to estimate the thruster force ($f_{th}$) using the
empirically validated steady state relation
$f_{th}=k_{th}\omega_{th}|\omega_{th}|$, where $k_{th}$ is an
empirically identified constant\cite{pona.book}.
%
The vehicle's control system is capable of actively controlling
6-\ac{DOF} vehicle motion.
%
During an experiment, each of the 6 \ac{JHUROV} \ac{DOF} were
independently actuated using either closed-loop control or open-loop
sinusoidal commanded torques. 
%
For the \acp{DOF} using closed-loop control,
a sinusoidal reference trajectory was specified to the \ac{JHUROV} control
system.

The coordinate frames employed herein are depicted in Figure
\ref{appenJHUHTF.fig.refFrames}.
%
The world-frame's orthonormal x, y, and z basis vectors point from the
frame's origin towards the direction north, east, and down
respectively.
%
Employing standard navel architecture conventions, the body-frame's
orthonormal x, y, and z basis vectors point, respectively, from the
vehicle's origin to the vehicle's bow, starboard side and keel.
%
The Euler angles heading, pitch, and roll express the relationship
between the world-frame and body-frame as follows: rotating the world-frame
about its +z-axis through an angle heading, then rotating the resulting
frame about its +y-axis through an angle pitch, then rotating the
resulting-frame around its +x-axis through an angle roll provides the
body-frame.

The sensors used in all experimental evaluations are recorded in Table
\ref{appen_JHUHTF.tb.sensors}.  
%
The \ac{JHUROV} is instrumented by a PHINS III \ac{INS} (IXSEA SAS,
Marly-le-Roi, France), \unit{1200}{\kHz} bottom-lock Doppler sonar (RD
Instruments, San Diego, CA), and 8CDP010-1 Digiquartz Depth Sensor
(Paroscientific Inc., Redmond, WA).  
%
The PHINS III \ac{INS} includes a three-axis north-seeking fiber-optic
gyrocompass, and inertial grade accelerometers whose data is used to
estimate angular velocity, pitch, roll, and heading states at a rate
of \unit{10}{\Hz}.  
%
For our PHINS configuration, the measurement error standard deviations
are 0.01$^\circ$/s for angular velocity estimates, 0.13$^\circ$ for
heading estimates, and 0.01$^\circ$ for pitch and roll
estimates\cite{PhinsManual2008}. The Doppler sonar measures the three
dimensional linear velocity in the instrument's frame with a standard
deviation of less than 0.003 m/s, an update rate of \unit{6}{\Hz}, and
zero bias\cite{NWHdataSheet}.
%
The Digiquartz has a maximum depth of 10 m and, as currently
configured, has an update rate of \unit{7}{\Hz}, and provides pressure
measurements at a resolution of 2 parts-per-million.
%
Translational position estimates are provided by the DVLNAV control
software which integrates the the sensor signals reported above to
provide dead reckoning XY translational position estimates better than
0.5\% of distance traveled.
