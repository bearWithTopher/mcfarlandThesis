\section{Parameter Identification Evaluation}
\label{appenJHUHTF.sec.paramEvalMethod}

To evaluate the performance of the identified plant models we employ
an approach that we refer to as {\it cross-validation}.  
% 
We use the plant model experimentally identified from one vehicle
experimental trial to predict, in a numerical simulation, the
performance of the plant in a different experimental trial
whose trajectories differ from the identification trial.
%
The class of plants given by (\ref{chModels.eq.UVSO3plant}) and
(\ref{chModels.eq.UVSE3plant}) are open-loop-stable in their velocity
signals as a consequence of hydrodynamic damping. 
%
In the presence of significant buoyancy torque due to
\ac{COB} to \ac{COG} separation, both classes of
plants are also open-loop-stable in roll and pitch.
%
Because these open-loop signals are stable, we can employ these
signals to compare a model plant's predicted performance to the
actual plant's experimentally observed performance.
% 
The error between the predicted model performance and the
experimentally observed performance is reported as the \ac{MAE}
between the simulated plant roll, pitch, and velocity and the actual
experimental plant roll, pitch, and velocity.
