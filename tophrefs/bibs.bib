  abstract = {This paper reports two new methods for the problem
	
	of in-situ calibration of the alignment rotation matrix between
	
	Doppler sonar velocity sensors and gyrocompass attitude sensors
	
	arising in the navigation of underwater vehicles. Previously
	
	reported solutions to this alignment calibration problem require
	
	the use of navigation fixes from an absolute external navigation
	
	fixes of the underwater vehicle, thus requiring additional navi-
	
	gation sensors and/or beacons to be located externally and apart
	
	from the underwater vehicle. We report a alignment calibration
	
	method employing only internal vehicle navigation sensors for
	
	velocity, acceleration, and attitude. Results from simulation data
	
	comparing these new methods to previously reported methods
	
	indicate satisfactory performance of the proposed methods in
	
	the presence of simulated sensor noise.},
