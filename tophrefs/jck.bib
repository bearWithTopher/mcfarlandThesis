  abstract = {A new designed Autonomous Underwater Vehicle r2D4 for operation to
	4,000 meters was built for the purpose of seafloor mapping on the
	oceanic ridge having hydrothermal activity in July 2003. An expanded
	interferometry sonar with operating frequencies of 100 kHz was installed
	on the AUV for highly resolve bathymetry mapping, not to mention
	backscatter imaging. In effect, the interferometry sonar is simply
	composed of three hydrophones, which are arranged at intervals of
	three and thirteen wavelengths in the L-shape at each side, in addition
	to a side scanning sonar Klein System 2000 with operating frequencies
	of 100 kHz and 500 kHz. It explains features of low cost and low
	power consumption. An initial survey test of the AUV was carried
	out up to 500 meters deep off Ryotsu port of Sado Island in July
	2003. In advance of the sea test of the AUV, a test of the interferometry
	sonar with the barge had been carried out. L-shape array of hydrophones
	enables us to make a phase difference measurement with high resolution
	and successfully. It follows that detailed swath bathymetry was brought
	about. Consequently, a seafloor mapping was carried out to reveal
	the detail topography on the top of Kuroshima knoll in the vicinity
	of Okinawa islands in December 2003. The AUV is installed with the
	PHotonic Inertial Navigation System (PHINS) [1], which provides inertia!
	navigation and motion measurements of the AUV. Furthermore, since
	the AUV is able to move underwater very stably along planed courses,
	it is a proper platform in materializing the synthetic aperture of
	the side scanning transducers. We have been devoting ourselves to
	processing the observation data. As a result, the synthetic aperture
	technique was very useful for improvement of the seafloor bathymetry
	mapping as expected. © 2004 IEEE.},

	directly applicable to Bayesian navigation techniques. The algorithm
	for creating the representation has three main components: Mixed-density
	sensor model using Gaussian and uniform probability distributions,
	measurement classification and multipath model identification using
	expectation- maximization (EM), and grid-based spatial representation.

	how the Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE) was used to successfully
	locate the deepest part of a pond. ABE computed the total water depth
	by combining the computed vehicle depth with the return of a single
	beam sonar altimeter. While moving in a straight line, ABE was able
	to estimate the gradient of total water depth along the vehicle track.
	By executing circular maneuvers, ABE was further able to estimate
	the 2D horizontal slope of the bathymetry. These two functions were
	combined to produce a procedure to locate the deepest point in the
	search region. This was accomplished without the need for a global
	navigation system. It is discussed how a vehicle with the capabilities
	of ABE could be used to locate hydrothermal vents using temperature,
	optical backscatter or chemical tracers as the search parameter.
	Data from an actual preprogrammed survey conducted by ABE in an area
	of sea-bed hydrothermal activity is illustrated. This data has been
	combined with measurements conducted by moorings, towed vehicles
	and the manned deep submersible Alvin to create a mathematical model
	of a vent field as might be seen by an AUV maneuvering through the

	methodology presented here is grounded in the Kalman Filter framework
	and uses its three basic steps: prediction, measurement, and update.
	In the prediction step, the vehicle location with uncertainty (state
	and state covariance) is estimated by using the previous vehicle
	location and dead reckoning. In the measurement step, the current
	sonar image is matched to the map using the mean absolute difference
	dissimilarity parameter. Because of the potential for large uncertainties
	in both the depth values of the image and those of the map, a suite
	of good matches is accepted rather than the single best match. The
	location of each match is considered a measurement of the vehicle
	position. Finally, each match (measurement) is weighted probabilistically
	using data association techniques, and the resulting best estimate
	and associated uncertainties comprise the navigation update. This
	updated position is then used as a basis for the next prediction
	step, and the process is repeated. Using real bathymetric data from

	for position updates include GPS surface fix, DGPS-USBL, Underwater
	Transponder Positioning (UTP) and bathymetrie terrain navigation.
	Based on synthetic aperture sonar technology, a potentially revolutionary
	accurate velocity measurement is under development. HUGIN also comes

	applied to increase navigational integrity and maximize position

	Control Technologies has been tasked by ONR to develop autopilot
	and simulation software for several REMUS 600 sensor configurations,
	with the objective of achieving enhanced platform steadiness to improve
	sensor performance in the shallow water and very shallow water environment.
	The most stringent motion steadiness requirements for the REMUS 600
	vehicle are derived from the image forming specifications of a new
	side-looking synthetic aperture sonar developed for ONR by the Penn
	State Applied Physics Laboratory and the Coastal Systems Station,
	Panama City, Florida. This payload necessitated the use of a forward
	fin section for enhanced control authority. This forward fin section
	gives the vehicle the ability to command vertical and horizontal
	sideslips, in addition to roll, pitch, and yaw control, using independently
	commanded fins. This is a unique capability for a vehicle of this
	class. In addition, the 12.75 inch diameter vehicle class offers
	new capabilities for endurance and payload capacity. The REMUS 600
	software architecture has been designed with the flexibility to accommodate
	various payloads and both the VCT autopilot and the Woods Hole autopilot.
	We present the VCT approach to autopilot design which makes use of
	a high- fidelity hydrodynamics model, software in the loop simulation
	test, vehicle motion steadiness performance predictions, and post-test

	suitable for localising an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The
	proposed CML algorithm uses a standard off- the-shelf sonar for sensing
	the environment. The returns from the sonar are used to detect targets
	in the vehicle's vicinity. These targets are used in conjunction
	with a vehicle model by the CML algorithm to concurrently build an
	absolute map of the environment and localise the vehicle in absolute
	coordinates. In order for the algorithm to work, the stored targets
	must be associated to the sonar returns at each iteration. Given
	the nature of sonar data, false returns complicate this process.
	The choice of targets and a suitable data association strategy is,
	therefore, vital. The chosen targets consist of returns of a significant
	strength. The segmentation detects these targets and calculates (a)
	the relative position of their center of mass with respect to the
	vehicle, (b) the targets' surface size, and (c) the targets' first
	invariant moment. This information is used by the system to perform
	the data association. We have chosen to adapt the well known multiple
	hypothesis tracking filter (MHTF) to the CML structure. This is a
	measurement oriented approach that finds the probability that an
	established target gave rise to a certain return. The paper presents
	results with real sonar data.},

	to enhance the navigation capabilities of an unmanned underwater

	Based on experience gained in the employment of long-baseline acoustic
	navigation approach using the divers acoustic navigation system (DANS)
	in support of the explosive ordnance disposal remote work packages
	program (EODRWP), DIAS provides for navigation of small subsea vehicles
	operating in shallow water without requiring reliance on external
	reference points reducing operational complexity. The primary navigation
	components in DIAS include a recently developed high-frequency (1200
	kHz) Doppler velocity log and a relatively low-cost, low-power, miniature
	solid-state inertial package. Sensor data collection, prefiltering
	and integration is accomplished using a low-power digital signal
	processor (DSP) based single board computer (SBC) resulting in a
	system that requires less than 14 Watts power dissipation. Data is
	integrated using Kalman filtering techniques reducing long term errors
	introduced by the Doppler and short-term errors introduced by the
	inertial sensors. The paper describes DIAS development and testing
	and contrasts the accuracies of the developed system versus the previously
	employed long-baseline approach. The integration of DIAS within the
	EODRWP and at-sea employment using the Cetus AUV completes the paper},

	rely on the INS without the aid from DVL. This decreases the accuracy
	of AUV positioning significantly when there exist flow disturbances
	like sea currents. In the proposed method, deviation from the reference
	trajectory is evaluated right after the vehicle starts bottom tracking
	with DVL operation. A lattice of test interval consisting of few
	verification way points are installed at the entrance of the reference
	trajectory. On these way points, deviations in vehicle position are
	evaluated referring to the SSBL estimation. Uncertainty in the scattered
	SSBL measurement is mitigated by optimally regressed test interval.
	Evaluated deviation is transmitted to the AUV via the underwater
	acoustic communication, to update the current vehicle position in
	INS. Developed method was testified during the Kuroshima survey mission
	of "r2D4", the latest sea-cruising AUV by IIS, the University of
	Tokyo, to convince its usefulness in field application.},

  abstract = {The focus of this paper is the development of tools to facilitate
	the effective use of AUVs to survey small-scale oceanographic processes.
	A fundamental difficulty in making oceanographic surveys with autonomous
	underwater vehicles (AUVs) is the coupling of space and time through
	the AUV survey trajectory. Combined with the finite velocity and
	battery life of an AUV, this imposes serious constraints on the extent
	of the survey domain and on the spatial and temporal survey resolutions.
	In this paper, we develop a quantitative survey error metric which
	accounts for errors due to both spatial undersampling and temporal
	evolution of the sample field. The accuracy of the survey error metric
	is established through surveys of a simulated oceanographic process.
	Using the physical constraints of the platform, we also develop the
	"survey envelope" which delineates a region of survey parameter space
	within which an AUV can sucessfully complete a mission. By combining
	the survey error metric with the survey envelope, we create a graphical
	survey analysis tool which can be used to gain insight into the AUV
	survey design problem. We demonstrate the application of the survey
	analysis tool with an examination of the impact of certain survey
	design and parameters on surveys of a simple oceanographic process.},
