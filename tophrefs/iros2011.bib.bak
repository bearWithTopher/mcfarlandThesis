  abstract = { The inertial parameters of manipulator rigid-body loads and links
	have been automatically estimated as a result of gen eral movement.
	The Newton-Euler equations have been recast to relate linearly the
	measured joint forces or torques via acceleration-dependent coefficients
	to the inertial parame ters, which have then been estimated by least
	squares. Load estimation was implemented on a PUMA 600 robot equipped
	with an R TI FS-B wrist force-torque sensor and on the MIT Serial
	Link Direct Drive Arm equipped with a Barry Wright Company Astek
	wrist force-torque sensor. Good estimates were obtained for load
	mass and center of mass, and the forces and torques due to movement
	of the load could be pre dicted accurately. The load moments of inertia
	were more difficult to estimate. Link estimation was implemented
	on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm. A good match was ob tained
	between joint torques predicted from the estimated parameters and
	the joint torques estimated from motor cur rents. The match actually
	proved superior to predicted torques based on link inertial parameters
	derived by CAD modeling. Restrictions on the identifiability of link
	inertial parameters due to restricted sensing and movement near the
	base have been addressed. Implications of estimation accu racy for
	manipulator dynamics and control have been consid ered. },

	manipulators is addressed with emphasis on the physical feasibility
	of the identified set of parameters. The dynamic model on which the
	identification procedure is based considers rigid-link robots including
	a complete actuator dynamics modeling and is obtained starting from
	the Gibbs&#150;Appell equations. Friction at the joints is also considered.
	The dynamic equations of the model are written linearly with respect
	to the dynamic parameters to be identified. The matrix form linear
	system is solved through a quadratic optimization procedure with
	non-linear constraints in order to ensure the physical feasibility
	of the identified parameters. The procedure is tested using a PUMA
	560 industrial robot. A comparison between control actions and torques
	obtained from the Inverse Dynamic Problem considering identified
	parameters is performed in order to establish the validity of the
	proposed procedure. The set of physically feasible dynamic parameters
	is used in an integration of the equations of motion of the robot
	and the results of the simulation are compared with the robot actual
	movement.},
