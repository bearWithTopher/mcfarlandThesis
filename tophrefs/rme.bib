  abstract = {Homing and navigation capabilities are essential in many autonomous
	underwater vehicle (AUV) applications. The paper presents both problems
	with respect to a single beacon. The difficulties of this approach
	are due to the fact that a single range measurement does not completely
	constrain the beacon's position in the vehicle frame. In order to
	triangulate his position, the AUV needs to maneuver while measuring
	its displacements between ranges. In addition, range measurements
	are noisy and sometimes spurious, speed bias and underwater currents
	affect dead- reckoning measurements. Homing and navigation procedures
	are the same beginning. In a first time, we have an initialization
	phase which is necessary to obtain an initial estimate of the vehicle's
	absolute position and of the disturbances affecting the quality of
	the dead reckoned displacements. These initials estimates are refined
	during the actual displacement towards the beacon by means of a Kalman
	filter. Two kinds of navigation are used so as to maximize the information
	matrix and to maintain an accurate absolute position. We present
	also postprocessing results and a comparison with LBL navigation.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a robust method for automatically matching
	features in images corresponding to the same physical point on an
	object seen from two arbitrary viewpoints. Unlike conventional stereo
	matching approaches we assume no prior knowledge about the relative
	camera positions and orientations. In fact in our application this
	is the information we wish to determine from the image feature matches.
	Features are detected in two or more images and characterised using
	affine texture invariants. The problem of window effects is explicitly
	addressed by our method - our feature characterisation is invariant
	to linear transformations of the image data including rotation, stretch
	and skew. The feature matching process is optimised for a structure-from-motion
	application where we wish to ignore unreliable matches at the expense
	of reducing the number of feature matches.},

	a sequence of arbitrary length. We discuss a scheme for handling
	occlusions (point features appearing and disappearing) and drift
	in the scale factor. These issues are crucial for the algorithm to
	operate in real time on real scenes. We describe in detail the implementation
	of the algorithm, which runs on a personal computer and has been
	made available to the community. We report the performance of our
	implementation on a few representative long sequences of real and
	synthetic images. The algorithm, which has been tested extensively
	over the course of the past few years, exhibits honest performance
	when the scene contains at least 20-40 points with high contrast,
	when the relative motion is "slow" compared to the sampling frequency
	of the frame grabber (30Hz), and the lens aperture is "large enough"
	(typically more than 30° of visual field).},

	This paper proposes an EM-based algorithm, which solves the model
	learning and the data association problem in parallel. The algorithm
	is developed in the context of the the structure from motion problem,
	which is the problem of estimating a 3D scene model from a collection
	of image data. To accommodate the spatial constraints in this domain,
	we compute virtual measurements as sufficient statistics to be used
	in the M-step. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
	method called chain flipping, to calculate these statistics in the
	E-step. Experimental results show that we can solve hard data association
	problems when learning models of 3D scenes, and that we can do so
	efficiently. We conjecture that this approach can be applied to a
	broad range of model learning problems from sensor data, such as
	the robot mapping problem.},

	The problem is framed as finding the maximum likelihood structure

	assignments of 3D features to 2D measurements. This goal is achieved
	by means of an algorithm which iteratively refines a probability
	distribution over the set of all correspondence assignments. At each

	input a set of 'virtual measurements' derived from this probability
	distribution. The distribution needed can be efficiently obtained

  abstract = {A fully decentralized architecture is presented for data fusion problems.
	This architecture takes the form of a network of sensor nodes, each
	with its own processing facility, which together do not require any
	central processor or any central communication facility. In this
	architecture, computation is performed locally and communication
	occurs between any two nodes. Such an architecture has many desirable
	properties, including robustness to sensors failure and flexibility
	to the addition or loss of one or more sensors. This architecture
	is appropriate for the class of extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based
	geometric data fusion problems. The starting point for this architecture
	is an algorithm which allows the complete decentralization of the
	multisensor EKF equations among a number of sensing nodes. This algorithm
	is described, and it is shown how it can be applied to a number of
	different data- fusion problems. An application of this algorithm
	to the problem of multicamera, real-time tracking of objects and
	people moving through a room is described.},

	estimate of the real parameter $\theta$. In this paper it is shown

	the $k$th Bhattacharyya bound, but not the $(k - 1)$th bound, then

	and $d(x)$ is a polynomial in $t(x)$ of degree $k$. Further, the
	variance of any polynomial in $t(x)$ of degree $k$ will achieve the
	$k$th bound, so that if any such unbiased polynomial exists, it will
	necessarily be uniformly minimum variance unbiased. Some properties
	of these polynomial estimates are discussed.},

	The tracker recovers the affine transformation of the region and

	edges and texture information are exploited in an integrated way,
	while not requiring the complete region's contour. The tracker withstands
	zoom, out-of-plane rotations, discontinuous motion and changes in
	illumination conditions while achieving real-time performance for
	a region. Multiple tracked regions are grouped into disjoint coplanarity
	classes. We first define a coplanarity score between each pair of
	regions, based on motion and texture cues. The scores are then analyzed
	by a clique-partitioning algorithm yielding the coplanarity classes
	that best fit the data. The method works in the presence of perspective
	distortions, discontinuous planar surfaces and considerable amounts
	of measurement noise.},

	The analysis is not strictly formal but based both on thought experiments
	and mathematical derivation. The first part highlights the structure
	of uncertainty of an estimated map with the key result being "Certainty
	of Relations despite Uncertainty of Positions". A formal proof for
	approximate sparsity of so-called information matrices occurring
	in SLAM is sketched. It supports the above mentioned characterization
	and provides a foundation for algorithms based on sparse information
	matrices.
	
	
	Further, issues of nonlinearity and the duality between information
	and covariance matrices are discussed and related to common methods
	for solving SLAM.
	
	
	Finally, three requirements concerning map quality, storage space
	and computation time an ideal SLAM solution should have are proposed.
	The current state of the art is discussed with respect to these requirements
	including a formal specification of the term "map quality".},

  abstract = {When underwater vehicles navigate close to the ocean floor, computer
	vision techniques can be applied to obtain motion estimates. A complete
	system to create visual mosaics of the seabed is described in this
	paper. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the constructed mosaic is difficult
	to evaluate. The use of a laboratory setup to obtain an accurate
	error measurement is proposed. The system consists on a robot arm
	carrying a downward looking camera. A pattern formed by a white background
	and a matrix of black dots uniformly distributed along the surveyed
	scene is used to find the exact image registration parameters. When
	the robot executes a trajectory (simulating the motion of a submersible),
	an image sequence is acquired by the camera. The estimated motion
	computed from the encoders of the robot is refined by detecting,
	to subpixel accuracy, the black dots of the image sequence, and computing
	the 2D projective transform which relates two consecutive images.
	The pattern is then substituted by a poster of the sea floor and
	the trajectory is executed again, acquiring the image sequence used
	to test the accuracy of the mosaicking system.},

	and navigation. The position and orientation of an underwater vehicle
	can be calculated by integrating the apparent motion of the images
	which form the mosaic. A feature- based mosaicking method is proposed
	in this paper. The creation of the mosaic is accomplished in four
	stages: feature selection and matching, detection of points describing
	the dominant motion, homography computation and mosaic construction.
	In this work we demonstrate that the use of color and textures as
	discriminative properties of the image can improve, to a large extent,
	the accuracy of the constructed mosaic. The system is able to provide
	3D metric information concerning the vehicle motion using the knowledge
	of the intrinsic parameters of the camera while integrating the measurements

  abstract = {This paper proposes a position estimator that fuses monocular vision
	with accelerometer and gyro measurements to generate a direct, relative,
	6-DOF position estimate between a free-floating underwater vehicle
	and a stationary object of interest. This type of position estimate
	is useful in the context of autonomous manipulation tasks, during
	which the vehicle needs to control its position relative to objects
	in its environment. Most autonomous manipulation tasks are vision-based
	and assume known camera motion. However, on free-floating vehicles,
	camera motion is generally unknown and must be estimated together
	with relative position. Various vision-only systems have been used
	to estimate relative position and camera motion, but these are often
	difficult to implement in real underwater environments. The system
	we propose relies on vision to generate relative position information,
	but also fuses inertial rate sensors to reduce the amount of information
	that needs to be extracted from the vision system. The result is
	a system that is simpler and more robust than a vision-only solution.
	However, the use of inertial rate sensors introduces several issues.
	The rate measurements are subject to biases, which need to be estimated
	to prevent the accumulation of unbounded drift when the measurements
	are integrated. This problem is non-linear, which presents several
	challenges in the estimator design. This paper presents some results
	from initial experiments with a fixed- base manipulator. So far,
	we have implemented a simplified estimator for relative position
	when camera motion is known. The estimator is part of the closed-loop
	control of the manipulator. With this system, we have demonstrated
	a simple autonomous manipulation task.},

	aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity. Animal distribution and behavior
	are affected by changes in the geometry and structure of their environment.
	Therefore, predicting the effects of fragmentation on species assemblages
	requires a working knowledge of how individual species respond to
	habitat patches and boundaries. We measured the distribution and
	behavior of fishes in a northern Great Lakes coastal marsh in Mismer
	Bay, Lake Huron, a naturally patchy ecosystem. Using various sampling
	techniques, including mark-recapture and direct observation by snorkeling,
	we determined the relationship between fish species distribution,
	biotic and abiotic patch characteristics, and patch area. For dominant
	species we determined habitat utilization, mobility patterns, and
	behavioral patterns within patches and at boundaries. Fish abundance
	was related strongly to average water depth and the percent cover
	of floating and emergent macrophytes. Minimum patch area to maintain
	species assemblages was 128 m^2 for individual patches and 400 m^2
	for major patches combined. Fishes that were widely distributed,
	highly mobile, and most abundant were expected to be least affected
	by increasing isolation and configuration. Given all results, we
	expected four species to be least affected overall by fragmentation
	in Mismer Bay: bluntnose minow (Pimephales notatus), brook stickleback
	(Culea inconstans), common shiner (Luxilus cornutus), and rock bass
	(Ambloplites rupestris). Although our conclusions are site-specific,
	the investigative processes we describe are applicable to fragmentation
	in other ecosystems.},

	out an extensive mapping program of the southern Lau Basin spreading
	centers with high resolution bathymetry and sidescan data. They were
	also defined the overall distribution of mantle plumes along the
	ridges using miniature autonomous plume recorders and CTD tow-yos.
	These important new data were the first step of an integrated RIDGE
	2000 program of four cruises to identify the overall tectonic, petrological,
	hydrothermal and biological characteristics of the spreading centers
	to permit a well informed selection of targets for more focussed
	studies in coming years. During September and October of 2004, on
	board R/V Kilo Moana, we are carrying out the second phase of investigations,
	with the aim of identifying specific hydrothermal sites and providing
	regional sampling of lavas from the region. The primary tools of
	investigation for hydrothermal site discovery are the autonomous
	benthic explorer (ABE) as well as CTD's and bottom towed cameras.
	Making use of new CTD data to verify the plumes identified in the
	Martinez et al cruise, ABE is being used in three different modes.
	Phase I focusses on the water column at the level of the neutrally
	buoyant plume. These results enable planning of the more focussed
	Phase II, closer to the bottom, to provide high resolution bathymetry
	and characterization of the buoyant plume. Phase III provides photographic
	coverage of even more limited regions focussed on the vent fields
	defined in Phase II. Camera tows using TOWCAM are planned to provide
	the highest resolution images of new hydrothermal sites. This cruise
	represents the first attempt to use ABE in such a staged and systematic
	program of regional vent site discovery. Since the ship is free to
	carry out other investigations during the ABE dives, which can be
	24 hours or more in length, high density sampling of the various
	Lau Spreading Centers will be carried out at the same time as the
	hydrothermal investigations. A newly designed percussion core and
	free-fall winch provide the potential of very rapid sample turn around
	and the best sampling coverage of any back-arc spreading center.
	Shipboard analyses of rocks collected by dredging and percussion
	core and of fluids collected during CTD casts in conjunction with
	a double pass along the ridge system will permit hypothesis testing
	in real time. Preliminary results based on the multi-disciplinary
	sea-going program will be reported.},

	verification sea tests of the MARPOS(R) Doppler-inertial navigation
	system jointly implemented by Maridan A/S, Denmark, and the Technical
	University of Denmark for use onboard the MARIDAN series of AUVs.
	MARPOS(R) is a dead-reckoning based navigation system, the core of
	which is a state-of-the-art ring laser gyro (RLG) and a Doppler velocity
	log (DVL). The system also integrates a very accurate CTD sensor
	suite and a high quality embedded differential GPS receiver used
	at the surface for position initialization, a priori sensor calibration
	and moving base alignment of the INS. A series of accuracy verification
	tests were performed at a sheltered shallow water test facility,
	using a small surface vessel to allow simultaneous logging of DGPS
	reference positions and Doppler- inertial based dead-reckoning navigation
	data. The proven accuracy was 0.10\% of distance traveled for straight
	line trajectories and 0.02\% for site surveys, where navigation was
	performed in a confined area, typically 1×1 km. Results from a number
	of surveys carried out by a MARIDAN 150 AUV have confirmed the operational
	efficiency and robustness of the system. Correlation of overlapping
	sidescan sonar imagery indicates that the operational performance
	of MARPOS(R) actually surpasses the outcome of the surface vessel
	tests. A probable cause is the inherently more stable platform provided
	by an AUV as opposed to a small surface vehicle which is subjected
	to wave induced motion and the often more extreme sound velocity
	variations of the surface water layers},

  pages = {796--803},
  abstract = {We present a novel approach for the estimation of 3Dmotion directly
	from two images using the Radon transform. We assume a similarity
	function defined on the cross-product of two images which assigns
	a weight to all feature pairs. This similarity function is integrated
	over all feature pairs that satisfy the epipolar constraint. This
	integration is equivalent to filtering the similarity function with
	a Dirac function embedding the epipolar constraint. The result of
	this convolution is a function of the five unknownmotion parameters
	with maxima at the positions of compatible rigid motions.
	
	
	The breakthrough is in the realization that the Radon transform is
	a filtering operator: If we assume that images are defined on spheres
	and the epipolar constraint is a group action of two rotations on
	two spheres, then the Radon transform is a convolution/correlation
	integral. We propose a new algorithm to compute this integral from
	the spherical harmonics of the similarity and Dirac functions. The
	resulting resolution in the motion space depends on the bandwidth
	we keep from the spherical transform. The strength of the algorithm
	is in avoiding a commitment to correspondences, thus being robust
	to erroneous feature detection, outliers, and multiple motions. The

  abstract = {The wide-baseline stereo problem, i.e. the problem of establishing
	correspondences between a pair of images taken from different viewpoints
	is studied. A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence,
	the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess
	highly desirable properties: the set is closed under (1) continuous
	(and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and (2)
	monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near
	linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near
	frame rate) is presented for an affinely invariant stable subset
	of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER).
	A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences
	is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple
	measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions
	from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence
	discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative
	correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement
	regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments
	on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change
	of scale (3.5×), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation,
	occlusion, locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of
	the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates
	of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points
	to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are
	obtained. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	invariants for several combinations of deformations and photometric
	changes. Their validity and potential is corroborated through a series
	of experiments. Both the cases of indoor and outdoor images are considered,
	as illumination changes tend to differ between these circumstances.
	Although the generalised color moment invariants are extracted from
	planar surface patches, it is argued that invariant neighbourhoods
	offer a concept through which they can also be used to deal with
	3D objects and scenes. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Beam produces high resolution bathymetric contour charts of the seafloor

	received by the system. Such signals have been recorded digitally

	is made to relate the statistical properties of the bottom-backscattered

	of the seafloor surveyed. Acoustic boundary mapping over flat areas
	is achieved by following trend changes in the acoustic data both
	along and across track. Such changes in the acoustics are found to
	correlate with changes in bottom type or roughness structure. The
	overall energy level of a partial angular-dependence function of
	backscattering appears to depend strongly on bottom type, whereas
	the shape of the function does not. Clues to the roughness structure
	of the bottom are obtained by relating the shape of the probability
	density function of normal-incidence echo envelopes to the degree
	of coherence in the backscattered acoustic field.},

	conventional long base line (LBL) transceiver which measures acoustic
	time of flights (TOFs) between vehicle and small submerged transponders.
	Using only range data and no prior information other than approximate
	water column depth, we solve for both transponder location and vehicle
	trajectory. Results are given using data from a AUV operating in
	shallow water. A ground truth comparison is made with surveyed transponder
	locations and trajectory estimates from an on board Doppler/Compass/LBL
	derived navigation filter.},

	describes a number of extensions to the stochastic mapping framework,

  abstract = {This paper describes a Concurrent Mapping and Localisation (CML) algorithm
	suitable for localising an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The
	proposed CML algorithm uses a standard off- the-shelf sonar for sensing
	the environment. The returns from the sonar are used to detect targets
	in the vehicle's vicinity. These targets are used in conjunction
	with a vehicle model by the CML algorithm to concurrently build an
	absolute map of the environment and localise the vehicle in absolute
	coordinates. In order for the algorithm to work, the stored targets
	must be associated to the sonar returns at each iteration. Given
	the nature of sonar data, false returns complicate this process.
	The choice of targets and a suitable data association strategy is,
	therefore, vital. The chosen targets consist of returns of a significant
	strength. The segmentation detects these targets and calculates (a)
	the relative position of their center of mass with respect to the
	vehicle, (b) the targets' surface size, and (c) the targets' first
	invariant moment. This information is used by the system to perform
	the data association. We have chosen to adapt the well known Multiple
	Hypothesis Tracking Filter (MHTF) [1] to the CML structure. This
	is a measurement-oriented approach that finds the probability that
	an established target gave rise to a certain return. The paper presents
	results with real sonar data.},

  abstract = {We describe progress in matching shots which are images of the same
	3D location in a film. The problem is hard because the camera viewpoint
	may change substantially between shots, with consequent changes in
	the imaged appearance of the scene due to foreshortening, scale changes,
	partial occlusion and lighting changes. We develop and compare two
	methods which achieve this task. In the first method we match key
	frames between shots using wide baseline matching techniques. The
	wide baseline method represents each frame by a set of viewpoint
	covariant local features. The local spatial support of the features
	means that segmentation of the frame (e.g., into foreground/background)
	is not required, and partial occlusion is tolerated. Matching proceeds
	through a series of stages starting with indexing based on a viewpoint
	invariant description of the features, then employing semi-local
	constraints (such as spatial consistency) and finally global constraints
	(such as epipolar geometry). In the second method the temporal continuity
	within a shot is used to compute invariant descriptors for tracked
	features, and these descriptors are the basic matching unit. The
	temporal information increases both the signal-to-noise ratio of
	the data and the stability of the computed features. We develop analogues
	of local spatial consistency, cross-correlation, and epipolar geometry
	for these tracks. Results of matching shots for a number of very
	different scene types are illustrated on two entire commercial films.},

	itself globally, without any prior location estimate. This is achieved
	by matching distinctive landmarks in the current frame to a database
	map. A Hough Transform approach and a RANSAC approach for global
	localization are compared, showing that RANSAC is much more efficient.
	Moreover, robust global localization can be achieved by matching
	a small sub-map of the local region built from multiple frames.},

  abstract = {A key component of a mobile robot system is the ability to localize
	itself accurately and, simultaneously, to build a map of the environment.
	Most of the existing algorithms are based on laser range finders,
	sonar sensors or artificial landmarks. In this paper, we describe
	a vision-based mobile robot localization and mapping algorithm, which
	uses scale-invariant image features as natural landmarks in unmodified
	environments. The invariance of these features to image translation,
	scaling and rotation makes them suitable landmarks for mobile robot
	localization and map building. With our Triclops stereo vision system,
	these landmarks are localized and robot ego-motion is estimated by
	least-squares minimization of the matched landmarks. Feature viewpoint
	variation and occlusion are taken into account by maintaining a view
	direction for each landmark. Experiments show that these visual landmarks
	are robustly matched, robot pose is estimated and a consistent three-dimensional
	map is built. As image features are not noise-free, we carry out
	error analysis for the landmark positions and the robot pose. We
	use Kalman filters to track these landmarks in a dynamic environment,
	resulting in a database map with landmark positional uncertainty.},

	of accumulated errors. We define the global problem as an optimization
	over the graph of neighboring views, and we show how the graph can
	be decomposed into a set of cycles such that the optimal transformation
	parameters for each cycle can be solved in closed form. We then describe
	an iterative procedure that can be used to integrate the solutions
	for the set of cycles across the graph of views. This method for
	error distribution does not require point correspondences between
	views, and can be used to integrate any method of pairwise registration
	or robot odometry. © 2004 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The Ocean Engineering Department at Florida Atlantic University (FAU)
	and the Naval Postgraduate have implemented AUV acoustic positioning
	systems based on the Desert Star Dive Tracker short base line (SBL)
	system. The motivation for these implementation efforts was to develop
	a short range, inexpensive, but relatively high precision navigation
	system for each institution's autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).
	In the NPS case the SBL system is to support navigation of their
	Phoenix vehicle in mine reconnaissance type missions where the vehicle
	needs to more precisely locate obstacles and mine like objects. In
	the FAU case the SBL system is to support guidance of the Ocean Explorer
	(OEX) vehicle in rendezvous and docking maneuvers. The Dive Tracker
	SBL can produce supposed positioning accuracies on the order of 6"
	rms. FAU has build a portable easily deployed collapsible frame for
	supporting 3 SBL transducers or beacons. The frame is arranged in
	star that is anchored to the bottom. The baseline between transducers
	is approximately 20 ft. The OEX carries a transducer and electronics
	that compute its position relative to the baseline. A docking target
	placed near the baseline and anchored to the bottom. The location
	of the target is then determined by manually positioning the AUV
	transducer at the target and taking SBL fixes, A series of at-sea
	tests of this system have been conducted. This paper presents results
	of the at sea tests of this positioning system off the coast of Boca
	Raton Florida. The analysis will comment on the efficacy of this
	type of system for guidance of small AUVs in docking maneuvers},

  abstract = {'Invariant regions' are self-adaptive image patches that automatically
	deform with changing viewpoint as to keep on covering identical physical
	parts of a scene. Such regions can be extracted directly from a single
	image. They are then described by a set of invariant features, which
	makes it relatively easy to match them between views, even under
	wide baseline conditions. In this contribution, two methods to extract
	invariant regions are presented. The first one starts from corners
	and uses the nearby edges, while the second one is purely intensity-based.
	As a matter of fact, the goal is to build an opportunistic system
	that exploits several types of invariant regions as it sees fit.
	This yields more correspondences and a system that can deal with
	a wider range of images. To increase the robustness of the system,
	two semi-local constraints on combinations of region correspondences
	are derived (one geometric, the other photometric). They allow to
	test the consistency of correspondences and hence to reject falsely
	matched regions. Experiments on images of real-world scenes taken
	from substantially different viewpoints demonstrate the feasibility
	of the approach.},

  booktitle = {The Reykjavik Conf. on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem},
  year = {2001},
  address = {Reykjavik, Iceland},
  month = oct,
  abstract = {There have been considerable efforts in recent years to modify fishing
	gears and practices to target particular sizes and species of fish
	and other marine organisms more efficiently, as well as to have less
	impact on bottom habitats. Recent developments in navigational aids
	and instruments for improving the classification of bottom habitats
	enables the fishing industry to harvest target resources more efficiently
	and to reduce impacts on benthic habitats and their communities.
	These changes hold promise for the achievement of broader ecosystem
	objectives, such as maintaining species and ecosystem diversities.
	
	
	This paper provides a review of successful developments and applications
	of selective fishing techniques that have been used to achieve ecosystem
	objectives. For example, the introduction of turtle excluder devices
	(TEDs) in shrimp trawls has dramatically reduced mortality of endangered
	sea turtles; the declines of the by-catches and discards of finfish
	in many shrimp trawl fisheries has mainly been the result of the
	sorting grids and square mesh panels introduced in these fisheries;
	changes in the construction and operation of tuna purse seines have
	significantly reduced the mortality of dolphins that are incidentally
	captured; and technical measures to reduce the incidental catch of
	seabirds in longline fisheries have been successfully developed.
	By-catch considerations and gear modifications play an important
	role in the regulation of several major fisheries, and new by-catch
	reduction devices and other innovative gear modifications are continuously
	being proposed and tested to mitigate problems.
	
	
	This paper also reviews the status of the development of gears, instruments
	and practices that can reduce the impacts of fishing on benthic communities
	and their habitats. During the last two decades there has been increasing
	concerns over the effects of bottom-fishing activities on benthic
	ecosystems in all major regions where commercial fishing is done.
	The evidence that fishing gears may injure benthic organisms and
	at least locally reduce habitat complexity and cause reduced biodiversity
	has appeared in various media with increasing frequency.
	
	
	Finally, this paper discuss the most likely future development of
	commercial fishing practices, including an analysis of the likely
	consequences that changes to achieve ecosystem objectives might have
	on the efficiency of fishing. It is unlikely that gear modifications
	will eliminate all adverse effects completely - progress will take
	place by modest steps. Therefore, realistic short- and long-term
	objectives are necessary when attempting to minimize ecosystem impacts
	of a fishery. Managers should set measurable limits for by-catch
	levels and benthic disturbances caused by fishing gears. In many
	cases, a combination of technological improvement, active avoidance
	of areas and seasons of high by-catch rates (hot spots), and other
	management actions may be necessary to achieve the desired outcomes.
	Some gear modifications may make gears more expensive to construct,
	and more difficult to operate and maintain. Moreover, catches of
	marketable fish may be reduced. Measures and techniques that increase
	costs and reduce earnings are unattractive to fishermen. There is
	little point in introducing totally unacceptable concepts or modifications
	- they will probably fail. The fishing effectiveness and practicality
	of new designs are important because an inefficient gear will not
	be used or will be “sabotaged,” or may require so much additional
	fishing effort that overall impacts could actually be increased.
	Close cooperation between the fishing industry, scientists and other
	stakeholders will be necessary in the process of developing and introducing
	environmentally friendly fishing technology.
	
	
	In conclusion, technologies developed in recent years demonstrate
	that the impact of fishing gears on non-target species and habitats
	can be significantly reduced without major negative effect on the
	profitability of the fishing operation. Clearly, economic rewards
	should be offered for the creation of new types of gear and modifications
	that reduce by-catch and minimize impact on habitats.},

  abstract = {We consider how to calculate the probability that the sum of the product

	analysis is motivated by a specific problem in electrical engineering.
	To resolve the problem, two distinct steps are required. First, we
	consider ways in which we can assess the distribution for the product
	of two Normally distributed variables. Three different methods are
	compared: a numerical methods approximation, which involves implementing
	a numerical integration procedure on MATLAB, a Monte Carlo construction
	and an approximation to the analytic result using the Normal distribution.
	The second step considers how to assess the distribution for the
	sum of the products of two Normally distributed variables by applying
	the Convolution Formula. Finally, the two steps are combined to compute
	the distribution for the sum of products of Normally distributed
	variables, thus to calculate the probability that this sum of products
	is negative. The problem is also approached directly, using a Monte
	Carlo approximation.},

	the gross structure of the underlying reefs. Terrain-aided navigation
	promises to revolutionise the ability of marine systems to track

	dives and covered over 35 km of tracklines. Detailed power records
	were logged, which permits extrapolation of the ABE's performance

	keeping some image feature invariant. This warping equalizes the

	is straight. Mosaicing is done without camera calibration or knowledge
