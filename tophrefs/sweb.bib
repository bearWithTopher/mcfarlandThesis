	mechanism for collaborative distributed data fusion that provides

	substantially reducing redundancy in the information flow in the
	overall system. We consider a distributed data fusion system consisting

	unreliable. The proposed approach, which is based on hierarchial
	Markov decision processes and decentralized lookup substrate, will
	control the information exchange and data fusion process based, among
	the other parameters, on maximizing performance metrics of individual
	platforms, thereby enhancing the whole distributed system's reliability
	as well as that of each participating platform. Simulation examples

  abstract = {The present aim of this research is to design a navigation sensor
	suite for a newly built mobile robot using low cost multiple sensors.
	A basic requirement for an autonomous mobile robot is its ability
	to localize itself accurately. This paper describes an accurate method
	for generating navigational data for a wheeled mobile robot. An Adaptive
	Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) is used to fuse data from multiple
	low cost sensors. In order to estimate the spatial position of a
	wheeled robot, a combination of accelerometers, a rate gyroscope
	and two wheel encoders are used. The system discussed in this paper
	has more measurement sensors than system states and therefore the
	sensors give over-lapping, low-grade information affected by noise,
	bias, drift etc. The dynamics of the robot and sensor system are
	non-linear. Therefore an AEKF is used to estimate these overlapping
	low-grade measured sensor data and give the best possible estimate
	of the mobile robot position. The adaptive mechanism in this case
	uses the Riccatti Equation adaption. The basic idea is to change
	the Kalman Gain. This is done by changing the Process noise co-variance
	matrix adaptively. Simulations show an improved performance in the
	estimates from the AEKF when compared to the EKF.},

	underwater vehicle (AUV) applications. This paper presents both problems
	with respect to a single beacon and an extension of the method for
	multiple AUV operation using relative location. The difficulties
	of this approach are due to the fact that a single range measurement
	does not completely constrain the beacon's position in the vehicle
	frame. In order to triangulate his position, the AUV needs to maneuver
	while measuring its displacements between ranges. In addition, range
	measurements are noisy and sometimes spurious, speed bias and underwater
	currents affect dead-reckoning measurements. All operation need to
	have the same beginning. An initialization phase is necessary to
	obtain an initial estimate of the vehicle's location with respect
	to a fixed or moving beacon. These initial estimates are refined
	during the actual displacement towards the beacon by means of a Kalman
	filter. Two kinds of navigation are used so as to maximize the information
	matrix and to maintain an accurate absolute position. We also present
	post-processing results in comparison with LBL navigation and mission

  abstract = {In cooperative navigation, teams of mobile robots obtain range and/or
	angle measurements to each other and dead-reckoning information to
	help each other navigate more accurately. One typical approach is
	moving baseline navigation, in which multiple Autonomous Underwater
	Vehicles (AUVs) exchange range measurements using acoustic modems
	to perform mobile trilateration. While the sharing of information
	between vehicles can be highly beneficial, exchanging measurements
	and state estimates can also be dangerous because of the risk of
	measurements being used by a vehicle more than once; such data re-use
	leads to inconsistent (overconfident) estimates, making data association
	and outlier rejection more difficult and divergence more likely.
	
	
	In this paper, we present a technique for the consistent cooperative
	localization of multiple AUVs performing mobile trilateration. Each
	AUV establishes a bank of filters, performing careful bookkeeping
	to track the origins of measurements and prevent the use any of the
	measurements more than once. The multiple estimates are combined
	in a consistent manner, yielding conservative covariance estimates.
	The technique is illustrated using simulation results. The new method
	is compared side-by-side with a naive approach that does not keep
	track of the origins of measurements, illustrating that the new method
	keeps conservative covariance bounds whereas state estimates obtained
	with the naive approach become overconfident and diverge.},

	in the proposed method, is addressed. The information form of the
	Kalman filter (information filter) is used as the main algorithm
	for position estimation. The method is implemented as part of the
	navigation system for an autonomous land vehicle. The navigation
	system includes two independent loops which communicate through an
	assimilation unit. One loop incorporates inertial and GPS information
	and the other uses millimetre wave radar and encoder measurements
	to obtain local estimates. The information obtained from each measurement
	is then broadcast to the other loops after being synchronised. This
	information is used in an assimilation stage to achieve more accurate
	estimates. The assimilation takes place periodically, where the assimilation
	frequency can be selected. The performance of the navigation method
	is examined by comparing the resulting position estimates to those
	of independent navigation loops},

	represented in parametric form using low-dimensional vectors of sufficient
	statistics. The belief space, over which the value function must
	be estimated, has dimensionality equal to the number of sufficient
	statistics. Compared to methods based on discretising the state space,
	this work trades the loss of the belief space's convexity for a reduction
	in its dimensionality and an efficient closed-form solution for belief
	updates. Fitted value iteration is used to solve the POMDP. The approach
	is empirically compared to a discrete POMDP solution method on a
	simulated continuous navigation problem. We show that, for a suitable
	environment and parametric form, the proposed method is capable of
	scaling to large state-spaces.},

	In this paper, we present a robust decentralized algorithm for mapping

	an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in polar space allowing us to model
	the nonlinearities within the range-only measurements using Gaussian

	multi-modal decentralized framework enabling us to accurately model
	the ambiguities in range-based position estimation. Each node within
	the network estimates its position along with its neighbor's position
	and uses a message-passing algorithm to propagate its belief to its
	neighbors. Thus, the global network localization problem is solved
	in pieces, by each node independently estimating its local network,
	greatly reducing the computation done by each node. We demonstrate
	the effectiveness of our approach using simulated and real-world

  abstract = {As autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are becoming routinely used
	in an exploratory context for ocean science, the goal of visually
	augmented navigation (VAN) is to improve the near-seafloor navigation
	precision of such vehicles without imposing the burden of having
	to deploy additional infrastructure. This is in contrast to traditional
	acoustic long baseline navigation techniques, which require the deployment,
	calibration, and eventual recovery of a transponder network. To achieve
	this goal, VAN is formulated within a vision-based simultaneous localization
	and mapping (SLAM) framework that exploits the systems-level complementary
	aspects of a camera and strap-down sensor suite. The result is an
	environmentally-based navigation technique robust to the peculiarities
	of low-overlap underwater imagery. The method employs a view-based
	representation where camera-derived relative-pose measurements provide
	spatial constraints, which enforce trajectory consistency and also
	serve as a mechanism for loop-closure, allowing for error growth
	to be independent of time for revisited imagery. This article outlines
	the multi-sensor VAN framework and demonstrates it to have compelling
	advantages over a purely vision-only approach by: (i) improving the
	robustness of low-overlap underwater image registration, (ii) setting
	the free gauge scale, and (iii) allowing for a disconnected camera-constraint
	topology.},

	state framework. Such a framework is used in view-based representations
	of the environment that rely upon scan-matching raw sensor data to
	obtain virtual observations of robot motion with respect to a place
	it has previously been. The exact sparseness of the delayed-state
	information matrix is in contrast to other recent feature-based SLAM
	information algorithms, such as sparse extended information filter
	or thin junction-tree filter, since these methods have to make approximations
	in order to force the feature-based SLAM information matrix to be
	sparse. The benefit of the exact sparsity of the delayed-state framework
	is that it allows one to take advantage of the information space
	parameterization without incurring any sparse approximation error.
	Therefore, it can produce equivalent results to the full-covariance
	solution. The approach is validated experimentally using monocular
	imagery for two datasets: a test-tank experiment with ground truth,

	operating simultaneously in the same area. The communication system

  pages = {1 -6},

  abstract = {The growing demand for persistent underwater surveillance has led
	to a need to increase reliance on undersea distributed sensor networks
	for undersea target detection, classi fication and tracking. While
	tremendous progress has been made in the technology of small, relatively
	inexpensive sensors over the last decade, progress has lagged in
	the areas of sensor allocation and sensor management. How best to
	deploy and reposition sensors and small, unmanned vehicles (movable
	sensors) are important research questions that must be addressed
	to realize the intended use of these technologies. Realistic tactical
	sensor deployment scenarios do not provide the opportunity for a
	precise placement of sensors. Most likely, initial deployment will
	be somewhat random (e.g., deployment of sensors from a moving vessel).
	Additionally, sensors might have to be repositioned due to random
	sensor failure, degradation, drift due to ocean current or other
	environmental effects. While it is possible, through the use of geometric
	probability, to estimate of the coverage of randomly distributed
	sensor fields, optimum field coverage can only be obtained through
	the use of deterministic sensor positioning procedures. However,
	the initial randomly distributed sensor field can be used as a starting
	point for the optimal sensor placement. The same can be said for
	networks in which sensors have drifted out of position, experienced
	failures, or have (through random movement or collision) aggregated
	into clumps. Sensor redeployment might also be necessary due to changes
	in mission objectives. For example, improved intelligence might necessitate
	the need to reconfigure the network in order to detect the target
	of interest. This paper addresses various issues relating to repositioning
	of sensors in order to improve the coverage of the distributed sensor
	network. In addition to more traditional assignment algorithms, which
	minimize the total (equivalently, average) cost for moving all sensors,
	we conside- r various cost-based assignment techniques that aim to
	minimize maximal displacement. We argue that for some scenarios,
	especially small to moderate networks of sensors with limited fuel
	supply, the minimization of the maximal displacement is preferable
	to the solution of the more traditional assignment algorithm. The
	latter often produces results with relatively large costs for at
	least some of its assignments. This leads to diminished effectiveness
	over time for the sensor field. Since fuel supply is limited for
	these unmanned vehicles, we consider assignment procedures that will
	not deplete the vehicles' resources during the maneuvering phase.
	Finally, we compare the performance of several algorithms used to
	minimize the maximal cost associated with repositioning a field of
	movable sensors.},

	measure is very noisy, especially in an indoor environment due to

	the wireless node positions, while a localization error less than

	is to analyze and design "emergent" behaviors to enable the team
	of simple robots to perform plume tracing with the assistance of
	information theory. The first step in the design process is to define
	a fundamental tradeoff for collective systems between processing,
	memory, and communications for each robot in order to execute the
	desired collective behaviors. The baseline problem is to determine
	the minimum values for processing, memory, and communications simultaneously.
	This will enable the designer to determine the required information
	flow and how effectively the information resources are being utilized
	in collective systems. The solution to this baseline problem is an
	8-bit processor, no memory, and three words to communicate. The details
	of this solution are described in this paper. The second step is
	to extend the previous kinematic solution to a more general Hamiltonian
	based solution to develop a Fisher information equivalency. The Fisher
	information equivalency leads directly to necessary and sufficient
	conditions for stability and control of nonlinear collective systems
	via physical and information exergy flows. In particular, the creation
	of a "virtual/information potential" by the team of robots via the
	decentralized distributed networked sensors produces a direct relationship
	between proportional feedback control, stored exergy in the system,

  abstract = {Conventionally, in order to control an application over a data network,
	a specific networked control or teleoperation algorithm to compensate
	network delay effects is usually required for controller design.
	Therefore, an existing controller has to be redesigned or replaced
	by a newcontroller system. This replacement process is usually costly,
	inconvenient, and time consuming. In this paper, a novel methodology
	to enable existing controllers for networked control and teleoperation
	by middleware is introduced. The proposed methodology uses middleware
	to modify the output of an existing controller based on a gain scheduling
	algorithm with respect to the current network traffic conditions.
	Since the existing controller can still be utilized, this approach
	could save much time and investment cost. Two examples of the middleware
	applied for networked control and teleoperation with IP network delays
	are given in these two companion papers. Part I of these two companion
	papers introduces the concept of the proposed middleware approach.
	Formulation, delay modeling, and optimal gain finding based on a
	cost function for a case study on DC motor speed control with a proportional-integral
	(PI) controller are also described. Simulation results of the PI
	controller shows that, with the existence of IP network delays, the
	middleware can effectively maintain the networked control system
	performance and stabilize the system. Part II of this paper will
	cover the use of the proposed middleware concept for a mobile robot
	teleoperation. ? 2004 IEEE.},
