abstract={The Tethys autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a 110 kg vehicle designed for long-range, high- endurance operations. Performance goals include supporting a payload power draw of 8 W for a range of 1000 km at 1 m/s, and a power draw of 1 W for 4000 km at 0.5 m/s. Achieving this performance requires minimizing drag and maximizing propulsion efficiency. In this paper, we present the design of the propulsion system, explore the issues of propeller-hull interactions, and present preliminary test results of power consumption and efficiency. In recent underwater experiments, the propulsion system's power consumptions were measured in both Bollard pull tests and during the vehicle's flights. Preliminary results of power consumptions and efficiency are shown to be close to the theoretical predictions.},

pages={1 -11},
abstract={In March and April 2010, an International Submarine Engineering (ISE) Explorer Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), built for Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), was deployed to Canada's High Arctic. Its mission was to undertake under-ice bathymetric surveys in support of Canada's United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Outer Continental Shelf claim. During this deployment several under-ice records were broken and several new technologies were demonstrated. This achievement was in part the result of the development work that ISE and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) undertook from 1993 to 1996 on the Theseus AUV during the Spinnaker program. During this program Theseus successfully completed two 200 km under-ice missions from CFS Alert on Ellesmere Island. NRCan's AUV is an ISE Explorer class vehicle, with several innovative additions to make it suitable for Arctic survey work. Most notable are a 4000 m depth rated variable ballast system, a 1500 Hz long range homing system, and under ice charging and data transfer capabilities. A Short Range Localization (SRL) system was also developed for close range positioning. The homing and SRL systems were developed by Canadian defense scientists and engineers at DRDC. The Explorer's range was extended to approximately 400 km by adding an additional hull section to accommodate extra batteries. The Main Camp near Borden Island (78 #x00B0;13.50'N, 112 #x00B0;38.87'W) was the launch site for the AUV. It was launched from an 8 m by 2.5 m ice-hole, cut through 2 - 3 m of thick ice. After several test dives its first mission was a transit to a Remote Camp, over 300 km to the northwest. The AUV autonomously homed into the Remote Camp and was successfully docked at the ice-hole where, without being removed from the water, it was charged and survey data was downloaded, all through a 1.5 m square ice hole. Subsequently, a second survey mission greater than 300 km in round trip length was undertaken, - - after which the AUV returned back to the Remote Camp. Finally, the vehicle embarked on a return mission to the Main Camp for recovery. From beginning to end, the AUV spent nearly 12 days under the ice before being successfully recovered. In total, close to 1000 km of under ice survey was accomplished between the AUV launch, Remote Camp mission, and recovery. The AUV reached depths of 3160 m and transited at an average speed of 1.5 m/s at an altitude of 130 m off the seabed. ISE and DRDC are now preparing for a 2011 deployment to collect additional data UNCLOS data. Aspects of the pre-deployment that will be presented include fail-safe provisions, mission planning, risk assessment, and mission logistics. Operational aspects to be discussed will include dealing with AUV operations in the extreme cold, initialization of the inertial navigation system, under-ice acoustics, acoustic homing to the recovery site and the procedures for recovery.},

abstract={The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has been awarded funds by the National Science Foundation to develop a tethered robotic underwater vehicle for under-ice exploration by 2014. By employing a novel light-weight tether for data-only communications, the vehicle will provide the U.S. Polar Research Community with a capability to tele-operate, under direct real-time human supervision, a remotely-controlled inspection and survey vehicle under fixed ice at ranges up to 20 km distant from a support ship or other deployment site. Physical tethering of an underwater robot is required to provide low-latency, high bandwidth control and real-time data return. The vehicle will enable exploration and detailed exploration in under-ice environments through the use of high-definition video coupled to a suite of chemical and biological sensors. Long-range light-fiber tether technology provides the high bandwidth link necessary for real-time control under the direction of the science party which AUVs cannot meet.},

abstract={Few methods presently exist for routine benthic survey and sampling operations under permanent moving ice in high latitudes. Many benthic survey and sampling techniques commonly employed for blue-water oceanography are unsuitable for operations in ice covered seas due to the constrined maneuverability inherent in icebreaker operations. Over-theside deployments with lowered instruments prohibit ice-breaking and constrain the ship to the wind-driven motion of the ice. We propose that hybrid remotely operated vehicles (HROVs) with light data-only tethers could provide significantly enhanced under-ice scientific access to the world's high-latitude oceans. This paper identifies operational obstacles to benthic survey and sampling operations posed by permanent moving ice cover and proposes solutions to these obstacles.},

  abstract = { The inertial parameters of manipulator rigid-body loads and links
	have been automatically estimated as a result of gen eral movement.
	The Newton-Euler equations have been recast to relate linearly the
	measured joint forces or torques via acceleration-dependent coefficients
	to the inertial parame ters, which have then been estimated by least
	squares. Load estimation was implemented on a PUMA 600 robot equipped
	with an R TI FS-B wrist force-torque sensor and on the MIT Serial
	Link Direct Drive Arm equipped with a Barry Wright Company Astek
	wrist force-torque sensor. Good estimates were obtained for load
	mass and center of mass, and the forces and torques due to movement
	of the load could be pre dicted accurately. The load moments of inertia
	were more difficult to estimate. Link estimation was implemented
	on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm. A good match was ob tained
	between joint torques predicted from the estimated parameters and
	the joint torques estimated from motor cur rents. The match actually
	proved superior to predicted torques based on link inertial parameters
	derived by CAD modeling. Restrictions on the identifiability of link
	inertial parameters due to restricted sensing and movement near the
	base have been addressed. Implications of estimation accu racy for
	manipulator dynamics and control have been consid ered. },

	a complete actuator dynamics modeling and is obtained starting from
	the Gibbs&#150;Appell equations. Friction at the joints is also considered.
	The dynamic equations of the model are written linearly with respect
	to the dynamic parameters to be identified. The matrix form linear
	system is solved through a quadratic optimization procedure with
	non-linear constraints in order to ensure the physical feasibility
	of the identified parameters. The procedure is tested using a PUMA
	560 industrial robot. A comparison between control actions and torques
	obtained from the Inverse Dynamic Problem considering identified
	parameters is performed in order to establish the validity of the
	proposed procedure. The set of physically feasible dynamic parameters
	is used in an integration of the equations of motion of the robot
	and the results of the simulation are compared with the robot actual
	movement.},

	using some sets of base-parameter values may be not positive definite

	the set of base-parameter values could be used to judge if a set

	Hence, the result would directly contribute to model-based control

	a sufficient condition for the inertial matrix to be positive definite
	for each configuration of the manipulator is given by use of physical
	inertial parameters of the links composing the manipulator. By use
	of this condition and a set of “virtual parameters,” a scheme is
