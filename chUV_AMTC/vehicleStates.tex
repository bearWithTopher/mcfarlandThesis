\subsection{Notating Actual and Desired Vehicle States}

Throughout this chapter we will be concerned with two states in SE(3):
the actual state of the vehicle and the desired state of the vehicle.
%
The actual state of the vehicle will be notated with subscript $a$.  
%
The desired states will be notated with subscript $d$.
%
These states will be represented in three reference frames: states
represented in the inertial world-frame will be indicated using a
forward superscript $w$, states represented in the actual body-frame
will be indicated using a forward superscript $a$, and states
represented in the desired body-frame will be indicated using a
forward superscript $d$.  Homogenious transforms between these
different reference frames will use forward superscripts and
subscripts to indicate the transform being preformed, for instance the
homogenious matrix ${^w_a}H$ when left multiplied by a vector
represented in the actual vehicle reference frame would provide that
vector's world reference frame coordinates.

We represent the pose of the vehicle in exponential coordinates as
$\psi_a\in\mathbb{R}^6$ and the velocity of the vehicle as
${^a}v_a\in\mathbb{R}^6$.  Note that for ${^w_a}R\in\SO3$, the
rotation matrix from the actual body-frame to the world-frame, and
$p_a\in\mathbb{R}^3$, the position of the vehicle, we have
%
${^w_a}H=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
    {^w_a}R      & p_a  \\
    0_{1 \times 3}  & 1  \\
  \end{array} \right]
=e^{\widehat{\psi_a}}$
%
where $\widehat{\dot{} }:\mathbb{R}^6\to\se3$ is the standard operator
mapping $\mathbb{R}^6$ into the tangent space of $\SE3$.  ${^a}v_a$ is
constructed of ${^a}\nu_a\in\mathbb{R}^3$, the vehicle's body-frame
tranlational velocity, and ${^a}\omega_a\mathbb{R}^3$, the vehicle's
body-frame angular velocity, using the following relation
$v=\left[ \begin{array}{cc} {^a}\nu_a^T & {^a}\omega_a^T
  \\ \end{array} \right]^T$.

We represent the desired pose and velocity of the vehicle using 
$\psi_d\in\mathbb{R}^6$ and ${^d}v_d\in\mathbb{R}^6$ with ${^w_d}H$,
${^w_d}R$, $p_d$, ${^d}\nu_d$, and ${^d}\omega_d$ defined as above.
