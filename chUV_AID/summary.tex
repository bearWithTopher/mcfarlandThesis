\section{Summary}
\label{ch.UV_AID.summary}


This Chapter reported two \acf{AID} algorithms  for the dynamic
estimation of \acf{UV} plant parameters.
% 
The \acl{AID} algorithms require the signals of the plant's velocity,
position, and external inputs force, but it does not require any
specific controller, in contrast to previously reported model-based
adaptive tracking controllers.
% 
Many \acl{UV} systems do not allow for adaptive tracking controllers because
they are under-actuated or have other control constraints.
%
%Section \ref{sec.ROVAID} reported a new adaptive identification
%algorithm which is locally asymptotically stable in the
%velocity errors and locally stable in each parameter error.
%
Sections \ref{chUV_AID.sec.UVSO3exp} and \ref{chUV_AID.sec.UVSE3exp}
report comparative experimental evaluations of the \acl{AID} algorithms.
%
Both the \acl{LSPM} and \acl{AIDPM} were shown to match
closely the experimentally observed \acl{UV} input-output behavior.
%
Future work could address less conservative bounds for the initial
error in the parameter estimates, characterize more
precisely conditions for asymptotic parameter convergence, and compare
the relative strengths and weaknesses of adaptive and least squares
parameter identification methods.
